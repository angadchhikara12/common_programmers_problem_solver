# Common Programmers Problem solver

I guess every programmer not/on Github often have problems running their creative and skillful programs but they sometimes run into a problem. Just from that problem I made this Problem Solver. It's not going to fix syntax or logical errors in your code. But it can solve some technical issues that are comming from your computer.

But just to make everything easy for everyone (especially the lazy ones), I build this program. It will just reboot your device like after hitting the Restart/Reboot button on your system. So I build this because of the upcoming era of Automation, and just trying to be cool on Github (unless someone sees it)ðŸ˜­.

## Thanks for using my repository
### that one click motivated me to make more of cool and automated thingsðŸ¥¹
